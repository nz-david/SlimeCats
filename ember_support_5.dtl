Ember: I used to think the only way to matter was to burn brighter than anyone else. Turns outâ€¦
Ember: Burning out helps no one.
Ember: Even sparks need a place to land.

	Ember: Hah. That's almost poetic.
	Ember: Nova would be proud.
	set {ember_bond_points} += 2

	set {ember_bond_points} += 1

	Ember: ...Maybe I'm finding a better one.
